## 💡 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 🎯 **High Priority**
1. **Set up Prisma Studio** for visual database editing
2. **Add "Start New Build" functionality** to create drones from UI
3. **Implement component dependency rules** (e.g., can't complete wiring before power)

### 🎯 **Medium Priority**
4. **Build status filtering** improvements (show only in-progress, etc.)
5. **Component search/filter** within drone details
6. **Basic build activity timeline** display

### 🎯 **Nice to Have**
7. **Dark mode** toggle functionality
8. **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
9. **Data export** basic functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started with Next Phase

To begin Phase 2 development:

```bash
# 1. Set up Prisma Studio for database management
npx prisma studio

# 2. Create feature branch for next development
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-admin

# 3. Install additional dependencies as needed
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-checkbox

# 4. Start with highest priority items
```
