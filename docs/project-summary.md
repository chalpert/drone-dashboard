## 📊 **Data Structure**

Your system uses clean, simple interfaces:

```typescript
// Drone entity
interface Drone {
  id: string
  name: string           // "Surveyor Alpha"
  model: string         // "DJI Matrice 300" 
  status: 'active' | 'maintenance' | 'offline'
  battery: number       // 0-100
  location: { name: string, coordinates: { lat: number, lng: number } }
  lastSeen: string      // "2 min ago"
  flightTime: number    // Hours today
  missions: number      // Total completed
}

// Mission entity
interface Mission {
  id: string
  name: string          // "Area Survey - Downtown"
  status: 'planned' | 'active' | 'completed'
  progress: number      // 0-100
  drone: string         // Associated drone name
  startTime: string     // "09:30 AM"
  estimatedEnd: string  // "11:45 AM"
  location: string      // "Zone A"
}
```

## 🔄 **Migration Status**

   - Weather integration

## 🛠️ **Development Workflow**

### **Adding New Features**
```bash
# Create new page
mkdir app/\(site\)/new-feature
touch app/\(site\)/new-feature/page.tsx

# Add to navigation in layout.tsx
const navigation = [
  // ... existing items
  { name: 'New Feature', href: '/new-feature', icon: NewIcon },
]
```
